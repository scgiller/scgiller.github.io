Regarding a dataset of US state level SAT scores (separated by Math and Verbal) and a field called "rates," there is one surprising trend that raises questions about the data: as rate increases, test score (either math or verbal) decrease. The rate field also has a remarkably wide range (high of 81 and low of 4). It is unclear how the rate is calculated. Is it possible that only 4% of eligible high school students took the SAT in certain states?

Along similar lines, as the rate field increases, both math and verbal score tend to decrease. While I did not find this to be intuitive, there may be a good reason (depending on how the rate statistic is calculated). If only "good test takers," say, the top x percentile, are taking the SAT, a state would be expected to have a low participation rate and an average score higher than the US average.

Looking at the "US SAT Rate by State Map," it is apparent that rates are much higher in states on each coast than in the middle of the country. I have no idea why this would happen.

More intuitively, almost all states with higher in one section had higher scores in the other section. This trend is almost perfectly linear, with the exception of Ohio. Besides Ohio, the largest difference between the Math and Verbal score in a single state is 30 points (Hawaii has a Math score 30 points higher than their Verbal score). Ohio's Verbal score is 95 points higher than their Math score.

Interestingly, both Math and Verbal Scores in the "All" field are slightly above 500. SAT scores are scaled so that the average total score is 1,000, so it is slightly surprising that the sum of the Math average score (514) and the Verbal average score (506) is 1,020. As we only have one year of data, it would be interesting to see how these values fluctuate on a year to year basis.
