Aside from general nostalgia, a look at the Billboard Hits dataset from the year 2000
provides an interesting snap shot at both the music industry and some insight into
what makes a hit song.

Random Data Fact!

One interesting note about the data is the extreme number of songs that were on the
Billboard list for exactly 20 weeks. Is there something about the way Billboard
collects its data that cuts off certain songs after 20 weeks?

What is Considered a Hit?

There are many ways for a song to be considered a hit. A song could rise to the
top 10 on the Billboard list in a given week. A song could maintain its status on
the charts for an extended period of time. I was curious whether there was a way to
predict either of these measures of success using the available data.

My initial thought was to test whether the number of weeks a song was on the Billboard
list was predictive of the top rank that the song achieved. Or, conversely, maybe
the top rank a song achieved was predictive of number of weeks a song lasted on the
Billboard list.

Running two simple, one variable OLS regression measuring number of weeks on the
Billboard list against the top rank (and vice versa) showed no relationship. Both
models had r-squared figures below 0.3. Measuring the number of weeks on the list
against top rank actually had a positive, significant coefficient on the number of
weeks variable.

Including the debut rank as an additional independent variable (along with the number
of weeks on the list) appears to be a much better fit. The r-squared figure raises
to .91 and the number of weeks variable has the expected sign. For each additional week
on the Billboard chart, the expected top rank was just over two places better.
Meanwhile, the relationship between the debut rank and the top rank was almost
one-to-one. For each individual debut rank closer to 100, the top rank increased
by one.

Additional Questions!

My research into the annual Billboard Top 100 List raised additional questions that
I was unable to verify with the data provided.

Does the success of one song by an artist generally precede additional hit songs?
There are a number of songs that disappear from the charts before returning. What causes
a return to the list? Maybe a music video or an appearance in a movie or awards show?

There are also, of course, other ways to look at the data. What to make of the Genre
field, which doesn't seem to fit with genre expectations (after all, I am the expert
guest on the 'Are You Entertained' podcast).

The length of the track might matter as well. Many hit songs follow a traditional
pattern (a couple verses separated by a catchy hook), and songs that do not follow
this format might have a harder time reaching the Billboard charts.
