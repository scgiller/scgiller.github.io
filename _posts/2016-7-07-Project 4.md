Predicting Data Science Salaries from Indeed.com Job Postings

How Much Does Your Job Title Reflect Your Job Responsibilities
A Look at Data Scientist Salaries from Indeed Job Postings

My goal for this project was to determine whether it was possible to predict the
salary of a job posting on Indeed based mostly on the job title and job location.
A search on Indeed.com for Data Scientist jobs paying at least a $20,000 / year
salary in 13 different cities, I was left with a sample of 230 different jobs
from 126 different companies that offered a salary or salary range in the job posting.

Washington, DC offered the most job opportunities with 45, but the most lucrative
place to work was Seattle, where the ten job postings carried an average of $146,500.
Not surprisingly, San Francisco, New York, and Chicago were also lucrative places
to work. Both New York and Philadelphia have job postings for $250,000, which tied
for the highest in the data.

The median salary for the entire dataset was $112,500.

Financially, Miami is the worst place to look for a Data Scientist position. Of the
eight job postings, none offered a salary above the median for the dataset. San
Francisco offered the job with the lowest salary: $21,295.

There are four companies with at least 10 different job postings: Workbridge Associates,
All-In Analytics, Jobspring Partners, and Smith Hanley Associates.

While a logistic regression did not show a strong relationship between location
and expected salary, it was clear that a few cities, specifically Seattle, San
Francisco, New York, and Chicago had a statistically significant impact on expected
salary (as represented by above or below the median).

Slightly altering the model to account for specific words in the job title showed
a slight impact. Job titles with the words "senior" or "manager" tended to pay more.
These additions also improved the overall fit of the model.

Not surprisingly, there is a wide spread of potential roles for people looking
for Data Scientists positions. In fact, job title may not be enough to provide
an accurate description of true job qualifications or responsibilities a job may
hold. A future study should look at the specific qualifications listed for each job.


Extra Notes:
1. Cities included New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Austin, Atlanta, Seattle, Miami,
Los Angeles, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington DC, San Diego, and Raleigh.
2. A key assumption is that each job posting on Indeed represents a single job
opening.
