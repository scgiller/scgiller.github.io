Determining Factors that Influence Airport Delays

While flight delays and cancellations are at times unavoidable, they are unquestionably
an inconvenience for travelers around the world. In an effort by the FAA to understand
where the worst delays are and what causes the delays, I analyzed annual data (2004-2014)
from 74 airports around the country.

All metrics were split between arrivals and departures. While an airport has complete
control as to whether a flight is able to depart on time, they can also significantly
impact the efficiency of arrivals. We are able to analyze these types of efficiencies
using given metrics including taxi delays, block delays, and airborne delays.

Across the sample, there were over 136,000 departure cancellations - about .15%
of all flights. The relationship between number of total departures and both total
number of cancellations and total number of diversions is mostly linear:

While it does appear that larger airports have proportionally more cancellations
than smaller airports.

In an effort to separate airports by their ability to prevent delays and cancellations,
I used the K-Means clustering technique. Because the data included a number of variables
with an unclear impact on the total efficiency of the airport, I also used a Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm to condense the features into three total features
(PCA was performed after standardizing each variable - given that some of the metrics
were raw totals, others were percents, and others were averages, it was important
to take space and distance into consideration).

At the airport/year level, airports fit into two different clusters:

In order to determine the impact of each of our original features on the clusters,
I performed three different tree-based classification models to predict whether an
airport/year would be in Cluster 1 or Cluster 2. Then using feature importance,
I was able to see which features most contributed to clustering.

Feature importance was highly dependent on the type of model. Using both a standard
decision tree classification and an extra trees classification, Taxi Out Time was
the most important feature:

Using a random trees classification, total Departure Cancellations and Arrival
Cancellations were the most important features (see above for visualization of
departures):

Raw cancellations are most likely difficult to improve upon; there are too many instances
of whether creating unsafe travel conditions. However, intuitively, taxi out time
is an area where improving logistics can significantly decrease the average delay time.
Taking a closer look at the data, the airports with the worst average departure delays
not only have the worst average taxi out times, but are all in the same region: JFK,
LGA, EWR, PHL, and HPN are all either in the New York Tri-State area or very close in
Philadelphia.
